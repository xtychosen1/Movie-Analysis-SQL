# Movie-Analysis-SQL
In this project, I will write more advanced queries on a database designed to resemble a real-world database system - MySQL’s Sakila Sample Database.
The development of the Sakila sample database began in early 2005. Early designs were based on the database used in the Dell whitepaper (Three Approaches to MySQL Applications on Dell PowerEdge Servers).
The Sakila sample database is designed to represent a DVD rental store. The Sakila sample database still borrows film and actor names from the Dell sample database.
